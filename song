 Yellow Wolf 
 Lyrics 
 
Momma said no carbonated soda 'fore you go to bed
But I never listened to her
A too little hoop with a tinfoil mold
For the cheap hydros illegal I'm sure
And I learned from watching the neighbors
Yeah, Watching the neighbors
Got me a droid that's cheap
Feeling real hot and here from my pocket the pager
